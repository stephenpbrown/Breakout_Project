-Homework 2: Breakout game
-Due 9/14/16

Description:
This game invokes the spirit of the classic breakout game, while adding a few extra features
including side paddles you have to control with the up arrows! You go through 3 different levels
with varying speeds and bricks. The game adds up scores based on number of bricks hit in a row
and will store high scores. Try to hit as many bricks in a row as you can to get the high score!

Keyboard shortcuts (with control key):

1: Level 1
2: Level 2
3: Level 3
4: "Game Won!" screen
L: Add extra lives

Keyboard shortcuts (without control key):
P: Pauses the game (Spacebar then unpauses the game)
